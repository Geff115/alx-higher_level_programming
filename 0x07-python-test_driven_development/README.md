Python
UnitTests
TDD


Requirements:
Python Scripts:
	- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	- All my files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
	- All my files should end with a new line
	- The first line of all my files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
	- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	- My code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
	- All my files must be executable
	- The length of my files will be tested using wc

Python Test Cases:
	- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	- All my files should end with a new line
	- All my test files should be inside a folder tests
	- All my test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
	- All my tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
	- All my modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
	- All my functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')

Side note:
	A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
